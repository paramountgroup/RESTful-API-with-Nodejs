# RESTful-API-wth-Node.js

Udacity Blockchain developer project RESTful Web API with Node.js Framework by Bob Ingram
 
 * This program creates a web API using Node.js framework that interacts with my private blockchain
 * Submits and retrieves data using an application like postman or url on localhost port 8000 http://localhost:8000/api/block/
 * The boilerplate code for this project was taken from the Udacity Web Services with Node.js lesson 2 
  practice express.js exercise and incorporates private blockchain from project 2.

## Getting Started - Steps to Follow

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Open the terminal in the directory you downloaded the repository and install npm: `npm install`.
3. Install express.js: npm install express --save
4. Run your application `node app.js`
5. Test your Endpoints with Curl or Postman.  http://localhost:8000/api/block/



## Prerequisites  - Node.js
This API requires node.js, node package manager (npm) & express.js

### To install install node.js on your windows machine:

* Download the Windows installer from the Nodes.jsÂ® web site.
* Run the installer 
* Follow the prompts in the installer 
* Restart your computer


The API Creates Two Endpoints per the project rubric

**GET Block Endpoint**
GET request using URL path with a block height parameter. The response for the endpoint provides a block object is JSON format.

	URL
	http://localhost:8000/block/[blockheight]

	Example URL path:
	http://localhost:8000/block/0, where '0' is the block height.

	Response
	The response for the endpoint provides a block object is JSON format.

	Example GET Response
	For URL, http://localhost:8000/block/0

	`{
					"hash": "7749df61bffc6ca0c7f169fccbb52794ac66d485aa6114792d4b70413ce259a2",
					"height": 0,
					"body": "First Block - Genesis Block",
					"time": "1542737644",
					"previousBlockHash": ""
	}`

**POST Block Endpoint**
Post a new block with data payload option to add data to the block body. The block body supports a string of text. The response for the endpoint provides the block object added the blockchain in JSON format.

	Response
	The response for the endpoint provides a block object in JSON format.

	Example POST response
	For URL: http://localhost:8000/block/block

	{
	    "hash": "157c14376cacca729dc82edc74ac87dffda527b1d026b3930396df1935c000f6",
	    "height": 1,
	    "body": "block",
	    "time": "1542737794",
	    "previousBlockHash": "7749df61bffc6ca0c7f169fccbb52794ac66d485aa6114792d4b70413ce259a2"
	}
