# RESTful-API-wth-Node.js

Udacity Blockchain developer project RESTful Web API with Node.js Framework by Bob Ingram
 
 * This program creates a web API using Node.js framework that interacts with my private blockchain
 * Submits and retrieves data using an application like postman or url on localhost port 8000 http://localhost:8000/api/block/
 * The boilerplate code for this project was taken from the Udacity Web Services with Node.js lesson 2 
  practice express.js exercise and incorporates private blockchain from project 2.

## Getting Started - Steps to Follow

1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Open the terminal in the directory you downloaded the repository and install npm: `npm install`.
3. Install express.js: npm install express --save
4. Run your application `node app.js`
5. Test your Endpoints with Curl or Postman.  http://localhost:8000/api/block/



## Prerequisites  - Node.js
This API requires node.js, node package manager (npm) & express.js

### To install install node.js on your windows machine:

* Download the Windows installer from the Nodes.js® web site.
* Run the installer 
* Follow the prompts in the installer 
* Restart your computer


The API Creates Two Endpoints per the project rubric

**GET Block Endpoint**
GET request using URL path with a block height parameter. The response for the endpoint provides a block object is JSON format.

	URL
	http://localhost:8000/block/[blockheight]

	Example URL path:
	http://localhost:8000/block/0, where '0' is the block height.

	Response
	The response for the endpoint provides a block object is JSON format.

	Example GET Response
	For URL, http://localhost:8000/block/0

	`{
					"hash": "7749df61bffc6ca0c7f169fccbb52794ac66d485aa6114792d4b70413ce259a2",
					"height": 0,
					"body": "First Block - Genesis Block",
					"time": "1542737644",
					"previousBlockHash": ""
	}`

**POST Block Endpoint**
Post a new block with data payload option to add data to the block body. The block body supports a string of text. The response for the endpoint provides the block object added the blockchain in JSON format.

	Response
	The response for the endpoint provides a block object in JSON format.

	Example POST response
	For URL: http://localhost:8000/block/block

	{
	    "hash": "157c14376cacca729dc82edc74ac87dffda527b1d026b3930396df1935c000f6",
	    "height": 1,
	    "body": "block",
	    "time": "1542737794",
	    "previousBlockHash": "7749df61bffc6ca0c7f169fccbb52794ac66d485aa6114792d4b70413ce259a2"
	}
## Use Postman to test 
API The Postman Echo API is service you can use to test your REST clients and make sample API calls. It provides endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, various auth mechanisms and other utility endpoints.
